# Discord-Bot

__________________________________________________________________________________
I programmed the discord bot to be interractive and respond to commands. Here's how it works.
__________________________________________________________________________________

Greetings:

User: hello 

Bot: Hello! How are you doing?'

_

User: howdy

Bot: Pleased to meet you

_

User: hi

Bot: How's it going?

Sad Messages:

I gave the bot a set list of encouraging messages within the code to respond to the key words: "sad", "depressed", "unhappy", "angry", "miserable". After seeing those key words it takes a random sentence from the list of encouraging and sends it back to the user. 

Encouraging list of messages being 

"Cheer up!", 

"Hang in there!",

"You got this!",

"I know it's tough, but you're tougher!",

"Don't stress. Be strong!",

"Sending some good vibes and happy thoughts your way",

"If you ever need to talk, or just cry, you know where to find me!",

"Dont worry because the next chapter of your life is going to be so amazing!"

I also made it so that the user can add encouraging messages of their own to the bot. And once you type in one of the key words, it will randomly take one of the encouraging messages from the list and maybe even spit your encouraging message back at you.

Example:

User: I am sad

Bot: Cheer up!
_

User: I am feeling unhappy today

Bot: Hang in there!

_

User: $new I know you can do it!
Bot: New encouraging message added

Inspiring quotes:

I programmed the bot to fetch quotes from the website https://zenquotes.io/. And I told the bot, in my code, to take a random quote from the website and send it to the user when  the user gives the command $inspire

Example:

User: $inspire

Bot: Do not look for a sanctuary in anyone except your self. ~Buddha

_

User: $inspire

Bot: One of the advantages of being disorganized is that one is always having surprising discoveries. ~A.A. Milne

_

User: $inspire

Bot: Pursue what catches your heart, not what catches your eyes. ~Roy T. Bennett

Jokes: 

Similar to the inspirational quotes, I programmed the bot to fetch Chuck Norris jokes from the website https://api.chucknorris.io/. And I told the bot, in my code, to take a random joke from the website and send it to the user when the user gives the command $joke

Example:

User: $joke

Bot: Steven Segal is not a real person. He's just Chuck Norris in disguise.

_

User: $joke

Bot: If you ask Chuck Norris what time it is, he always says, "Two seconds till." After you ask, "Two seconds till what?" He roundhouse kicks you in the face.

_

User: $joke

Bot: In an objective, scientific sense, looking at an image of Chuck Norris erodes your soul.

And that concludes my bot's functionalities and how the bot works
